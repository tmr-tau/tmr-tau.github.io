Setting up two-factor authentication in GitLab
----------------------------------------------

Login to your account here [https://github.com]

If you don't have an account, you can `make one here <https://github.com>`_.

Once you login to your account, make sure you setup Two Factor Authentication in `settings <https://https://github.com/settings/security>`_.

Keep in mind to save the backup codes somewhere safe in case you loose your device.
