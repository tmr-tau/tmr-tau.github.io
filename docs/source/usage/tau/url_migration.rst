URL Migration
-------------

In order to make this community of practice more trustworthy among many other reasons, 
we have migrated from the old url https://taugit.com to https://qtmcop.tmr.qld.gov.au

If you are a new user, ignore this guide.

Login to your account here [https://qtmcop.tmr.qld.gov.au] from now on. 

Your old credentials still work and all you have to do is point your local repositories to the new urls.

There are two ways to do this. 

**Command Line**

and for those who are not confortable using the command prompt. 

**Non Command Line / GUI / Editors**


- Open the .git folder in your repository. This may be hidden, so show hidden files in windows or do a similar thing in whatever OS you are on.

- Edit the file named config in your fav editor, and change the url there.
